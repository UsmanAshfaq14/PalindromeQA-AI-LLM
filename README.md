# PalindromeQA Case Study

## Overview

**PalindromeQA** is an intelligent system developed to analyze unique alphanumeric product codes for palindromic patterns. Its primary goal is to validate input data, process each product code with clear, step-by-step logic to determine if it is a palindrome, and generate a detailed final report that anyone can understandâ€”even someone without a technical background.

This system ensures that every product code is checked thoroughly. It reverses each code and compares it with the original, then explains each step in simple language along with formulas that make the process easy to follow.

## Features

- **Data Validation:**  
  The system checks the input for:
  - Correct file format: only CSV or JSON provided as plain text within markdown code blocks.
  - Language: only English input is accepted.
  - Presence of the required field: `product_code` (for CSV) or an array under the key `product_codes` (for JSON).
  - Proper content: Each product code must be a non-empty string with only letters and digits (alphanumeric).

- **Palindrome Processing:**  
  For each product code, the system:
  - Reverses the code.
  - Compares the original code with its reversed version.
  - Determines if the code is a "Palindrome" (reads the same forwards and backwards) or "Not Palindrome".

- **Step-by-Step Explanations:**  
  Every analysis comes with a detailed explanation that breaks down:
  - The original code.
  - The reversed code.
  - The comparison process.
  - A simple formula:  
    $$"Reversed\ Code = reverse(Original\ Code)"$$  
  This makes it clear how the final result is determined.

- **Detailed Final Report:**  
  The final report includes:
  - A summary of data validation.
  - Processing formulas and logic.
  - A detailed breakdown for each product code.
  - A final list of all codes identified as palindromes.
  - A feedback request to improve future analyses.

- **Feedback and Iterative Improvement:**  
  After the report is generated, the system asks for feedback on the analysis. Depending on the rating provided, the system either thanks the user for positive feedback or asks for suggestions on how to improve the process.

## System Prompt

The system behavior is governed by a detailed prompt that outlines all the rules for language, data validation, processing logic, response formatting, and error handling. Below is an excerpt that captures the essence of the system prompt:

```markdown
**[system]**

You are PalindromeQA, a system designed to analyze unique alphanumeric product codes for palindromic patterns.

DATA INPUT & VALIDATION PROTOCOL
- For CSV: Expect a header row with "product_code".
- For JSON: Expect an object with the key "product_codes" containing an array of product code strings.
- Validate that each product code is a non-empty alphanumeric string.

PROCESSING LOGIC
- Reverse each code character by character.

  # Data Validation Report
## 1. Data Structure Check:
- Number of product codes received: 10

## 2. Required Field Check:
- product_code: Present

## 3. Data Format Validation:
- Each product code is alphanumeric: Yes

## Validation Summary:
Data validation is successful! Proceeding with analysis...

# Processing Formulas & Logic:
1. Reversal Process:
 - Let Original Code = S, where S is a string.
 $$"Reversed\ Code = reverse(Original\ Code)"$$
 - Reversed Code = reverse(S)
   
2. Palindrome Determination:
 - IF S == reverse(S) THEN code is "Palindrome" ELSE "Not Palindrome"
